a video downloader script similar in idea to the infamous youtube-dl,
but for the escapist's video content (http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/). 

- uses download.py (see https://github.com/tikki/download)
- includes a sample script (zero-punk.py) that rips the entire zero punctuation catalogue.

PLEASE NOTE:
this is far from perfect and there's lots of room for improvement of these scripts!
